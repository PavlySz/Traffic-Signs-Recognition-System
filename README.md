# Traffic Signs Detection and Recognition System

## The Traffic Signs Detection and Recognition system is divided into two main subsystems:

 - Traffic Sign Classification: 
  - Given a cropped image of the sign, the model classifies it into one of the 43 traffic signs classes found in the GTSRB
  - The MobileNetv2 model acheieved an accuracy of 98%
  - The Inception v2 model achieved an accuracy of 99.8%
  
 - Traffic Signs Detection:
  - Given an image/ video frame of the road, the model detects and classifies the signs found in the frame
  - The FRCNN ResNet50 model achieved an accuracy of 92%
  - The FRCNN Inception v2 model achieved an accuracy of 96%
